# Rsh (Port 514) Pentesting Checklist & Commands

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating Rsh (port 514), I realistically expect:

- [ ] Ability to run remote commands without password
- [ ] Weak or IP-based trust via .rhosts and /etc/hosts.equiv
- [ ] Easy spoofing on local networks
- [ ] Misconfigured NFS mounts storing .rhosts
