# Subversion (SVN) Pentesting Checklist & Commands

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating SVN (port 3690), I realistically expect to find:

- [ ] Anonymous access to repository listings
- [ ] Full repository downloads (source code, credentials, secrets)
- [ ] Commit logs with sensitive information
- [ ] Possible old or exposed revisions with secrets

---

## ‚úÖ Subversion Pentest Checklist

- [ ] **Service Discovery**
  - Confirm the service is running on 3690/tcp.
    ```
    nmap -Pn -sV -p3690 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Banner Grabbing**
  - Identify SVN version and server details.
    ```
    nc -vn <IP> 3690
    ```

- [ ] **Basic Enumeration**
  - List repository contents (if anonymous access is enabled).
    ```
    svn ls svn://<IP>
    ```
  - Check commit history for secrets or user info.
    ```
    svn log svn://<IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Downloading Repository**
  - Clone the entire repository for offline analysis.
    ```
    svn checkout svn://<IP>
    ```
  - Browse historical revisions for exposed secrets.
    ```
    svn up -r <revision_number>
    ```

## ‚úÖ Manual Tips

- Look for:
  - Hardcoded credentials in source code.
  - Configuration files (database, services).
  - Deployment scripts with secrets.
  - API keys or SSH private keys.
  - Comments in commit logs referencing passwords or internal infrastructure.

- Grep cloned repo for common patterns:
    ```
    grep -r 'password' <checkout_dir>
    grep -r 'secret' <checkout_dir>
    grep -r 'apikey' <checkout_dir>
    ```

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Disable anonymous access if not needed.
- Enforce authentication and authorization policies.
- Regularly audit repositories for sensitive data.
- Use client hooks to prevent committing secrets.
