# 1026 - Pentesting Rusersd

## 🎯 What am I realistically expecting to find here?

⭐ After enumerating rusersd (port 1026), I realistically expect to find:

- [ ]  Logged-in usernames
- [ ] User sessions and terminals
- [ ] Hostname of the target
- [ ] Potential login times for users

---

## ✅ Quick Info

- **Service:** rusersd
- **Default Port:** 1026/tcp (can vary)
- **Use Case:** Lists users currently logged into a remote machine
- **Discovery:** Often found via Portmapper / RPC service listing

---

## ✅ Rusersd Pentest Checklist

- **Check for Portmapper Exposure**
  - rusersd is usually registered with Portmapper/RPC.
  - Use nmap to identify:
    ```
    nmap -sV -p 111 <IP>
    rpcinfo -p <IP>
    ```

- **Install rusers Client**
    ```
    apt-get install rusers
    ```

- **Enumerate Logged-in Users**
    ```
    rusers -l <IP>
    ```

- **Review Results for Usernames**
  - Build a user list for password attacks.
  - Correlate login times for active sessions.

## ✅ Example Output

```
tiff potatohead:console Sep 2 13:03 22:03
katykat potatohead:ttyp5 Sep 1 09:35 14
```

## ✅ Notes

- Very useful for **username enumeration** on older Unix systems.
- Can help in **building a targeted wordlist**.
- Exposure via RPC often indicates other legacy services may be running.
