# Compaq/HP Insight Manager Pentesting Checklist & Commands

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating Compaq/HP Insight Manager (ports 2301, 2381), I realistically expect to find:

- [ ] Default admin interfaces with weak or default credentials
- [ ] Service banners revealing HP Insight Manager version
- [ ] Access to management dashboards over HTTP/HTTPS
- [ ] Misconfigured HTTPS (self-signed/expired certs)
- [ ] Exposed or downloadable config files
- [ ] No direct code execution expected by default

## ‚úÖ Insight Manager Pentest Checklist

- [ ] **Service Detection & Banner Grabbing**
  - Check for service version and open ports.
    ```
    nmap -vvv -Pn -sC -sV -p2301,2381 <IP>
    ```
  - Expected output example:
    ```
    PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
    2301/tcp open  compaqdiag
    2381/tcp open  compaq-https
    ```

- [ ] **Browser Access & Manual Inspection**
  - Navigate to the web interface:
    ```
    http://<IP>:2301
    https://<IP>:2381
    ```
  - Look for:
    - Login pages
    - Version info in footers or banners
    - SSL/TLS certificate warnings

- [ ] **Check for Default Credentials**
  - Try default usernames and passwords from:
    ```
    http://www.vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk/passwordsC.htm
    ```

- [ ] **Look for Sensitive Config Files**
  - Check for downloadable or exposed config/log files if file browsing or path disclosure is possible:
    ```
    path.properties
    mx.log
    CLIClientConfig.cfg
    database.props
    pg_hba.conf
    jboss-service.xml
    .namazurc
    ```

## ‚úÖ Vulnerability Considerations

- Older HP Insight Manager versions may be vulnerable to:
  - Default or weak credentials
  - Self-signed/expired HTTPS certs (MITM potential)
  - Exposed configuration/log files
  - Potential for information disclosure (e.g., internal IPs, hostnames)

## ‚úÖ Shodan Search

- Search for exposed interfaces:
    ```
    port:2301
    port:2381
    ```
