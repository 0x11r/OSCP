# ‚úÖ Echo Service (Port 7) Enumeration Checklist & Commands

---

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating Echo (port 7), I realistically expect to find:

- [ ] Confirmation that the service is running (echoes input back)
- [ ] Potential for denial-of-service via echo loop attacks
- [ ] No authentication, no file access, no code execution possible

## ‚úÖ Echo Enumeration Checklist

- [ ] **Identify Service & Port**
  - Confirm the port and service.
    ```bash
    nmap -sV -p7 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Check Both TCP and UDP**
  - Scan for both protocols since echo often runs on both.
    ```bash
    nmap -sU -p7 <IP>
    nmap -sT -p7 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Interact with the Service**
  - Send data and verify echo response.
    ```bash
    nc <IP> 7
    Hello echo

    # UDP
    nc -u <IP> 7
    Hello echo
    ```

- [ ] **Test for DoS Reflection / Loop (Advanced / Warning)**
  - Document if service could be abused in reflection/amplification attacks.
  - Note potential for DoS if connected to another echo service.
  - Typically **do not** perform in live engagements without permission.

- [ ] **Check for Unexpected Behavior**
  - Look for modifications to input (rare).
  - See if any banners or unexpected messages are returned.
