# NDMP Pentesting Checklist & Commands

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating NDMP (port 10000), I realistically expect to find:

- [ ] Backup software version information
- [ ] Filesystem info (mounted shares, paths)
- [ ] Backup configurations that may leak sensitive data
- [ ] Potential credentials or session IDs
- [ ] No direct shell or privilege escalation, but info useful for lateral movement

## ‚úÖ NDMP Pentest Checklist

- [ ] **Banner Grabbing**
  - Check for version and vendor.
    ```
    nmap -n -sV -p10000 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Nmap Scripts**
  - Gather filesystem info and NDMP version details.
    ```
    nmap -n -sV --script "ndmp-fs-info or ndmp-version" -p10000 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Manual Testing**
  - Connect with netcat or telnet (often responds in clear text).
    ```
    nc <IP> 10000
    ```

## ‚úÖ Goals During Enumeration

- [ ] Identify NDMP server vendor/version (e.g., Symantec/Veritas Backup Exec)
- [ ] Extract list of mounted filesystems or backup paths
- [ ] Look for sensitive backup paths containing credentials
- [ ] Map out the NAS environment for lateral movement
