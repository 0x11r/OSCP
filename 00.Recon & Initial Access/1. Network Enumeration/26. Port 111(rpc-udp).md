# ‚úÖ Portmapper / RPCBind Pentesting Checklist & Commands

---

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating Portmapper, I realistically expect to:

- [ ] List exposed RPC services and their ports
- [ ] Identify services like NFS, NIS, rusersd
- [ ] Fingerprint OS/version based on RPC programs
- [ ] Plan next steps for attacking services like NFS (2049)

## ‚úÖ Portmapper / RPCBind Pentest Checklist

- [ ] **Scan for Portmapper**
    ```bash
    nmap -sV -p111 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Enumerate RPC Services**
    ```bash
    rpcinfo -p <IP>
    nmap -sU -sC -p111 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **If NFS Found ‚Üí Use NFS Checklist**
    - Show available exports
    ```bash
    showmount -e <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **If NIS Found ‚Üí Use NIS Checklist**
    - Check domain and dump maps
    ```bash
    ypwhich -d <domain> <IP>
    ypcat -d <domain> -h <IP> passwd.byname
    ```

- [ ] **If rusersd Found ‚Üí User Enumeration**
    ```bash
    rusers <IP>
    ```

## ‚úÖ Portmapper / RPCBind Useful Commands

- **Basic Enumeration**
    ```bash
    rpcinfo -p <IP>
    nmap -sU -sC -p111 <IP>
    ```

- **Shodan Search**
    ```
    port:111 portmap
    ```

---

## ‚úÖ Defensive Recommendations

- Restrict access to port 111 to trusted IP addresses.
- Disable unused RPC services (e.g., NIS, rusersd).
- Use firewalls to limit RPC exposure.
- Keep RPC services updated and patched.
