# BACnet Pentesting Checklist & Commands

## üéØ What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After enumerating BACnet (port 47808/UDP), I realistically expect to find:

- [ ] Building automation system details (HVAC, lighting, fire safety)
- [ ] Vendor information and device names
- [ ] Instance IDs and network configuration details
- [ ] Firmware or software versions for vulnerability research
- [ ] Possible control endpoints (but rarely direct unauthenticated control)
- [ ] Clues to broader OT/ICS network topology

## ‚úÖ BACnet Pentest Checklist

- [ ] **Service Detection**
  - Confirm open BACnet UDP port.
    ```
    nmap -sU -p 47808 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Nmap BACnet Enumeration**
  - Use the NSE script to gather device and network details.
    ```
    nmap --script bacnet-info --script-args full=yes -sU -n -sV -p 47808 <IP>
    ```

- [ ] **Manual Enumeration with BAC0 (Python)**
  - Install and use the BAC0 library for manual exploration.
    ```bash
    pip3 install BAC0
    ```
    ```python
    import BAC0
    bbmdIP = '<IP>:47808'
    bbmdTTL = 900
    bacnet = BAC0.connect(bbmdAddress=bbmdIP, bbmdTTL=bbmdTTL)
    print(bacnet.vendorName.strValue)
    # Try other properties and objects if supported
    ```
  - Note: BAC0 may not always replicate all Nmap script output. Additional manual testing may be needed.

- [ ] **Data Collection Goals**
  - Capture:
    - Instance IDs
    - Vendor Name and Model
    - Device Descriptions
    - Supported Services
    - Network Numbering/Topology
  - Identify building automation components:
    - HVAC systems
    - Fire detection systems
    - Access control systems
    - Lighting controllers
