# üéØ DCOM Execution Checklist & Commands

## What am I realistically expecting to find here?

‚≠ê After attempting DCOM-based execution, I realistically expect to:

- [ ] Execute remote commands through COM interfaces like MMC20, ShellWindows, Excel, etc.
- [ ] Bypass WinRM/SMB restrictions in some cases
- [ ] Use as stealthy execution for lateral movement
- [ ] Combine with valid credentials to maintain low-profile access
- [ ] Avoid detection by traditional AV and EDR tools

# ‚úÖ DCOMexec - Authenticated Remote Execution

## üõ† Execute via DCOM using MMC20

```bash
python3 dcomexec.py -object MMC20 test.local/john:password123@10.10.10.1
```

- Uses Distributed COM to remotely launch processes on the target
- MMC20 is a common object for command execution
- Works well when SMB or WinRM is disabled or monitored

---

## üîç Notes

- Requires valid domain or local credentials
- Must have appropriate DCOM access rights on the target
- Common DCOM objects used for execution:
  - MMC20
  - ShellWindows
  - ShellBrowserWindow
  - Excel.Application
  - WbemLevel1Login

## ‚úÖ Suggested Follow-up

```powershell
whoami
hostname
ipconfig /all
net user /domain
```

- Always verify privileges and network access after command execution
