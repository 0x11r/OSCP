If you gain access to a user account that has permissions to modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs), you can effectively control every computer or user linked to those GPOs. GPOs are used by system administrators to centrally apply settings, scripts, or security configurations across multiple systems in an organization. By modifying a GPO, an attacker can deploy malicious scripts, disable security features, harvest credentials, or execute code automatically whenever a user logs in or a machine reboots. Since GPOs refresh regularly, any changes will apply quickly and silently. This makes GPO compromise one of the most powerful and dangerous privilege escalation techniques in Active Directory environments.
